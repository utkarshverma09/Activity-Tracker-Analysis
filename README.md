This project is for a course that I have taken on a mooc platform. The R script is named as run_analysis.R and it does the following step
1. It checks if the file exists and it downloads it from web if it does not exist
2. Read files in test and train folders and merge x,y and subject files respectively.
3. It will only keep the measurements on mean and standard deviation.
4. Change and use descriptive and appropiate name to the activities in the data set.
5. It then creates a second tidy data set with mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Finally, it tranfers the final data to a text file called tidyData.txt
